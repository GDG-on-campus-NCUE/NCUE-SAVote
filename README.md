# SAVote (Secure Anonymous Voting)

**Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving Voting System for NCUESA**

SAVote is a next-generation electronic voting platform built with **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Groth16)**. It guarantees that votes are:
1.  **Anonymous**: No one (including admins) can link a vote to a specific user.
2.  **Verifiable**: Any user can cryptographically verify their vote was counted.
3.  **Unique**: Each eligible voter can only vote once per election.
